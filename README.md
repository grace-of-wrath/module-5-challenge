ASU Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp Module 5 Challenge 
In this challenge, I used Pandas and MatPlotLib within Jupyter Notebook to clean, visualize, and analyze data from a drug trial. I demonstrated my ability to merge and manipulate DataFrames, perform summary statistics, create various charts, calculate IQR, identify outliers, and calculate correlation and regression. 

Note: At many points I referenced classwork for applicable code, which I copied over and reworked for our purposes.
